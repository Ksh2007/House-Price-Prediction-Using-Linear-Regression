House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices by identifying the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.

Data : Housing.csv

Process:
1. Reading and understanding the data.
2. Data inspection.
3. Data cleaning.
4. Exploratory data analytics.
5. Data preparation.
6. Model building.
7. Residual analysis of training data.
8. Model evaluation.

Libraries used:
1. Scikit-learn
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy
4. Pandas
5. Seaborn

The equation of the best fitted line is:

price=0.35×area+0.20×bathrooms+0.19×stories+0.10×airconditioning+0.10×parking+0.11×prefarea
